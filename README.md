# a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

Most of the value coming from the users are between the age groups of 15-30. It looks like users between 20-24 are spending the most and making the most purchases. The age group form 15-19 sepend on average the same per user as the 20-24 year olds, but they do not make as many purchases as the 20-24 year olds. In addition there are a lot of users from 25-29 that spend a good amount of money on the game. 

We can also see that after 30 years old, there are a lot less purchases. It seems that for the age groups outside of the ones mentioned above, there are less purchasing being done. From this we can see that most of the users in the system are between the ages of 15-30. So the age groups that make up most of the users also see that they include the most purchases in the game.
